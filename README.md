MediLog is a web-based AI-driven memory aid that eliminates the need for manual input, making memory recall effortless. Unlike traditional note-taking tools, it transcribes conversations in real time using speech-to-text technology and automatically generates structured flashcards through named entity recognition (NER) and similarity matching. This ensures that important details—such as names, places, and recurring topics—are continuously refined, creating a dynamic and personalized memory log.

A key innovation is adaptive flashcards and AI-powered daily reflection. Instead of static notes, MediLog updates flashcards based on recurring conversations and pushes contextual reminders to reinforce memory. By incorporating sentiment analysis and engagement tracking, the platform can even offer early insights into cognitive decline, providing valuable data for caregivers. With privacy-focused design, AI-driven insights, and personalized interactions, MediLog transforms memory assistance into a smart, proactive, and user-friendly web app.
